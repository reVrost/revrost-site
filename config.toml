Hi there, I'm Kenley [(@revrost)](https://github.com/revrost), an engineer currently working at Immutable. I've been building software since I was 11 years old. Building products that people *use* is my biggest passion.

<br>

I am all for action over inaction and value iterating over planning. You can probably find me talking about cloud architecture, software philosophy, stock investing, fight club culture, and a sprinkle of LLMs.

<br><br>

On the side, I'm currently working on [Marketpal](https://marketpal.ai). Thanks for stopping by!
