Hi world and my blog that I left in the dust for years. Today is the year 2024,
AI is going to take over the world 16 years from now.

My new year resolution, writing this just after Lunar New Year of course.

By the end of the year, I should:

- have 10 books read
- make at least 1 commit every single day
- exercise for at least 30 mins a day
- have finish at least one of my side projects
- not be shy of writing blogs/thoughts, the world/internet is alraedy filled
  with junk information anyway
- contribute to one useful open source repo (this is a reach, but I should try
  to contribute something)
