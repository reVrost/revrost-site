Hi world and my blog that I left in the dust for years. Today is the year 2024,
I've been on hiatus on this blog and AI is taking over the world.

Just wanted to add some kind of a new year resolution, writing this just after
Lunar New Year of course.

By the end of the year, I should:

- have 10 books read
- make at least 1 commit every single day
- exercise for at least 30 mins a day
- have finish at least one of my side projects
- not be shy of writing blogs/thoughts
- contribute to one useful open source repo
